# Speech Recognition Project
This project demonstrates a Speech Recognition system using machine learning techniques. The system is developed to recognize speech and detect emotional tones in spoken words, leveraging the TESS (Toronto Emotional Speech Set) dataset. This project applies data preprocessing and model training to develop a reliable speech recognition model.

## **Overview**

This project aims to create a Speech Recognition system that can classify emotional states in speech. Utilizing the TESS dataset, it combines preprocessing techniques with machine learning models to achieve accurate recognition and classification of speech data.

## **Features**

• Preprocessing: Audio data cleansing, normalization, and feature extraction.
• Model Training: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for speech emotion recognition.
• Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## **Dataset**

The TESS (Toronto Emotional Speech Set) dataset, available on Kaggle, is used for training and evaluation. It contains various speech samples classified by emotional tone, essential for building a robust model.

## **How it Works**

The project processes audio data to recognize and classify speech by emotional tone. It involves data preprocessing (such as feature extraction and normalization), followed by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on labeled speech data. Once trained, the model can accurately identify the emotional category of new audio samples based on learned patterns.

## **Libraries Used**

• **Librosa**: For audio processing and feature extraction.

• **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling.

• **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing data insights.
